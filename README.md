1) Word and subword embeddings, a comparison

Comparison of vectorial word representations (embeddings) created by three different techniques:

* Embeddings created by using entire words as tokens and word2vector algorithm
* Embeddings created by using subwords as tokens (BPE tokenizer) and word2vector algorithm
* Embeddings created by using entire words and subwords as tokens (ngram tokenizer) and fastText algorithm

This comparison is carried out through similarity word tasks on general and rare words in the English language. Additionally, we classify these words into distinct morphological categories to dissect these differences.

The empirical evidence confirms that models harnessing subword-level information can effectively handle out-of-vocabulary words.

Datasets: WordSim-353, SynEngl, Sigmorphon
